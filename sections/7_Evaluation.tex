\section{Case study}
% \yh{We may 1) change terms like the epoch 5, 40 to the $5^{th}$, $40^{th}$ epoch; and 2) Capitalize the first letter of each word in view names such as cluster view to the Cluster View.}

In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiRNNExplorer in analyzing model behaviors and feature importance. 
We use the air pollutant data between 2015 to 2017 to train the model and use 8,375 cases in 2018 as testing data for analysis. 
% Notice that feature importance and hidden unit response are calculated on testing data,  
% The testing dataset contains the 8,375 individual cases in the year 2018.
The accuracy and hyper-parameters of different models are listed in Table~\ref{table:model_configuration}. 
We demonstrate our system to the domain expert and analyze the trained models on several tasks.

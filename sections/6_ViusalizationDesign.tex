\section{Visualization Design}


In this section, we introduce the visual design based on the design tasks discussed in Sec.\ref{section:design_tasks}.  As shown in Fig.\ref{fig:teaser}, the visual analytic system consists of six coordinated views. Starting from the configuration panel Fig.\ref{fig:teaser}B, the users are able to select the target feature and the model to be analyzed. The region partition will be shown as Fig.\ref{fig:teaser}B after the model is selected. To support exploring the model mechanism, the Cluster View is displayed to summarize the hidden units' response to the features (Fig.\ref{fig:teaser}A) and the Feature Importance View (Fig.\ref{fig:teaser}C) is shown to visualize the temporal importance of each feature. Furthermore, the users can select the individual cases in the Projection View (Fig.\ref{fig:teaser}E) and all the selected individual cases are grouped by similarity and displayed in the Individual View (Fig.\ref{fig:teaser}D).
